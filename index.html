        <h3>The Biopanther</h3>

<p>After discovering a keycard, the player opens a locked door into a new area, a cave filled with sulfuric vents that release toxic gas. Traversing the overworld is done in a top-down 2D style and they move on a grid-based system. The player has a torch, emitting a modest aura of light around them, allowing them limited visibility. The cave is full of sulfuric vents that emit a green gas aura. Standing too close to the vents causes the player to get poisoned, so they walk the path between the vents to avoid the toxic gas. As they explore the cave, they hear the low growl of a predator, a sign that they have been detected by an enemy. The player can either try to hide, run, or fight. The player decides to run, but in the dark, the player must rely on sound to evade the predator. But before they can escape, a giant three-headed hound catches them, initiating combat. The player is underprepared and is quickly defeated. Later, the player learns that the three-headed hound is eyeless, relying on scent to detect its prey. Using the sulfuric vents, the player can mask their scents. By equipping a gas mask, players can traverse this area without getting poisoned and without alerting the hound, adapting to this area and allowing them to survive.

    <h3>Biopanther Test Fight</h3>

    <p>When caught by the hound, the player is brought to the combat screen. They see the hound has three heads, four legs, a massive body, and a long tail with a scorpion-like stinger. Before the battle, the player is prompted with some text:
 “A massive predator has detected your scent”. 
The player can try to escape, but the chances are low due to the hound's speed, and failing an attempt loses them a turn, leaving them open to attack. Backed into a corner, the player has no choice but to try and fight. The player can attack with their weapon, use skills or items, or guard. The player assesses that the tail is most likely a large threat and must be dealt with immediately, but will not result in killing the beast. The player decides to attack the tail to eliminate a threat and generate fervor, increasing their damage and allowing them to cast offensive skills. Using a fire axe, the player does extra damage to the tail due to its weakness to slash damage. However, the hound's tail is durable enough to survive the blow. The hound retaliates with a swipe from one of its front paws, dealing decent damage to the player.
